/*
    You have a program which is parallelized and uses ùëõ independent threads to process the given list of ùëö jobs.
    Threads take jobs in the order they are given in the input.
    If there is a free thread, it immediately takes the next job from the list.
    If a thread has started processing a job, it doesn‚Äôt interrupt or stop until it finishes processing the job.
    If several threads try to take jobs from the list simultaneously, the thread with smaller index takes the job.
    For each job you know exactly how long will it take any thread to process this job,
    and this time is the same for all the threads.
    You need to determine for each job which thread will process it and when will it start processing.
